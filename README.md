The purpose of this study is to explore the terminology used in graduate computing-related programs and course titles at minority-serving institutions (MSIs), as a way of understanding curricular knowledge. We collected 5,776 courses titles associated with 173 computing-related graduate programs at 79 MSIs. We analyzed the most common terms appearing in program and course titles and used topic modeling to assess how terminology in course titles varies by degree level and institution type.
